## About Mehrdad Zakershahrak

**Position**: Lead AI/ML Scientist

### Overview

I have carved a niche for myself in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Born and raised in Shiraz, Iran, I embarked on my journey in technology with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Shiraz University, followed by a Master's in Computer Science from UNL. My learning path, focused on human-centered AI with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ASU, laid a solid foundation for my specialization in ML/AI.

Throughout my career, I have engaged with a broad spectrum of technologies, with a particular interest on Reinforcement Learning and its applications. My journey has also led me to become proficient in embedded C, distributed system architecture, database management, cloud infrastructure, and a variety of algorithms. Additionally, my expertise extends to areas like 3D graphics and robotics, showcasing my versatility in the tech domain.

A defining aspect of my approach is the pursuit of high performance in everything I build. This pursuit is rooted in my understanding that while computers are inherently fast, their full potential is frequently underutilized. I strive to tap into this untapped potential, ensuring that the systems and solutions I develop are not just functional, but also exceptionally efficient and responsive, a quality that, although often unspoken, is palpable to users.
